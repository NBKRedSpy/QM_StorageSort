# Storage Sort, Drop, and Single Drop

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

# Docs

Features:
* Adds a Sort hotkey to the containers in a raid as well as cargo screens in space.  Both default to S.  
* Adds the ability to sort the merc's backpack when in a raid.  Defaults to Shift+S.
* Adds a Drop All hotkey to containers.  Defaults to D.
* Adds the context menu command "Drop One".

Each feature can be disabled in the configuration by setting the key to None.

The drop key is useful when dropping gas from barrels in one keystroke.

The "Drop One" command is useful when dropping a single item from a stack to keep a door open.  For example, a piece of plastic.

The keys can be configured using the Mods button on the main screen or directly in the config file.

# "Drop One" and Context Menu Hotkeys Mod
To add a hotkey to the "Drop One" function in the Context Menu Hotkeys mod, 

Add this to the list of keys in the Context Menu Hokeys config file:

```json
    {
      "Key": "F",
      "Command": 620000
    },

```

The above will add the key F as the hotkey when the context menu is open.

# Configuration

The configuration file will be created on the first game run and can be found at `%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\StorageSort\config.json`.

## Key List
The list of valid keyboard keys can be found at the bottom of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html
Beware that numbers 0-9 are Alpha0 - Alpha9.  Most of the other keys are as expected such as X for X.
Use "None" to not bind the key.
